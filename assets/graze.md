# Fetch -- The MEGA65 Custom Web Client

This program is a simple browser for displaying and navigating a special 8-bit web.

Like the Internet you know from using "big computers", the MEGA65's 8-bit web uses
HTTP to deliver web pages, which can contain text and graphics, and links to other
pages on the same or other sites on the Internet.

Where it differs, is that these pages are not written using HTML, but use the H65
format, which consists of a memory image of a graphical display, together with
information about any links to other pages.
This allows considerable flexibility, and full use of the MEGA65's advanced graphics
in the pages, without the need for complex parsing and rendering software on the
MEGA65.

Thus while the tools for developing H65 pages may initially be rather
rudimentary, this can be improved without requiring the browser to be modified.
For example, proportional anti-alised text displays, similar to those used in
the [MegaWAT!?](/megawat.h65) slide presentation software will be possible.
